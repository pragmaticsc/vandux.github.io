  <h2>Full Stack Javascript and Ruby Developer</h2>

  <p>I enjoy implementing user interfaces and deconstructing problems or ideas in to many smaller, more solvable tasks.</p>

  <p>I am currently a senior software engineer at <a href="https://livingsocial.com/" title="experience marketplace" target="_blank">LivingSocial</a> and an advisor to <a href="http://noonpacific.com/" title="streaming music app" target="_blank">NoonPacific</a> and <a href="http://radical.fm" title="music sharing app" target="_blank">Radical.fm</a>. In the recent past I taught Front End Web Development at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/shaun-russell/1716" title="web learning institution" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> in Los Angeles, and wore many hats at <a href="http://caplinked.com" title="deal workflow management software" target="_blank">CapLinked</a> while it was a very early stage startup.</p>

  <p>I occasionally moonlight as a <a href="https://www.shopify.com/?ref=shaun-russell" title="use my referral code" target="_blank">freelance Shopify developer</a>. My most recent builds are <a href="http://shopdashonline.com" title="kardashian ecommerce" target="_blank">DASH Online Store</a>, <a href="http://bigraudio.com" title="custom headphones" target="_blank">BigRAudio</a>, and <a href="http://studio1040designs.com/" title="custom jewelry" target="_blank">Studio 1040</a>.</p>
