  <h2>Full Stack Javascript and Ruby Developer</h2>

  <p>I like to think of myself as more than an software developer. I have diverse experience in many roles across many projects, which has given me a solid understanding of software development processes and the web ecosystem.</p>

  <p>The success of a project is the most important, and I believe that user experience and product design has just as much to do with the outcomes as software implementation. Therefore, they are always at front of mind as I work. I prefer to work iteratively, and I think I am good at deconstructing problems or ideas in to many smaller, more solvable tasks, which allow for a tight feedback loop with stakeholders.</p>

  <p>I work at <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" title="cloud CRM software and more">Salesforce</a>, making learning fun with team <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/" title="learning salesforce is fun">Trailhead</a>.</p>

  <p>In the past I've worked on the product, checkout, and mobile teams at <a href="https://livingsocial.com/" title="experience marketplace" target="_blank">LivingSocial</a>, been an advisor to music curation application <a href="http://noonpacific.com/" title="streaming music app" target="_blank">NoonPacific</a> and music streaming application <a href="http://radical.fm" title="music sharing app" target="_blank">Radical.fm</a>, taught Front End Web Development at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/shaun-russell/1716" title="web learning institution" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> in Santa Monica, and wore many hats as employee #1 at <a href="http://caplinked.com" title="deal workflow management software" target="_blank">CapLinked</a>.

  <p>I occasionally moonlight as a technology consultant, and a <a href="https://www.shopify.com/?ref=shaun-russell" title="use my referral code" target="_blank">freelance Shopify developer</a>.</p>
